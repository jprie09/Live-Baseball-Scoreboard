# Live-Baseball-Scoreboard

This is a live scoreboard that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages. It uses Firebase for the backend for smooth real-time data transfer.

One key note before you setup this project is to make sure you have a lot of storage on your Firebase account as this does transfer a lot of data and constantly reads it as well.
