# Live-Baseball-Scoreboard

This is a live scoreboard that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages. It uses Firebase for the backend for smooth realtime data transfer.

One key note before you setup this project is to make sure you have a lot of store on your Firebase account as this does transfer a lot of data and is constantly reading it as well.
